# Elevate your datagGame: mastering Computational Data Governance

In previous articles, we've delved into implementing Computational Data Governance through data management process automation. We explored how process runtime metadata, operational metrics (like service levels, usage, and cost), and data quality dimensions can be combined into maturity levels of a Data Product, or even an overall certification level.

But how can we ensure these benefits are fully utilized? How can a Data Product owner be motivated to keep the product fit for purpose amidst growing data adoption?

How can an organization drive the adoption of these processes and keep data and data management maturity high on the agenda?

## Setting priorities

Not all datasets need to be perfect. Achieving this would be impossible and costly. Instead, data, packaged as a Data Product, needs to be fit for purpose.

Start by identifying important, business-critical datasets. Identifying critical business processes and their data dependency is a good starting point.

Define maturity levels and link measurable criteria to them. Based on metadata, a daily maturity level can be calculated and displayed in a Data Product Portal.

## Establishing targets

Set an initial target maturity level for each product, based on its criticality to dependent processes. Track progress towards this target through a standard KPI dashboard.

But don't stop there.

Gradually set more ambitious targets to increase data maturity and adapt to evolving needs. Making a dataset fit for purpose is essential, but this required fitness can evolve over time.

## Embracing ambition

Design your approach so that maturity level criteria can evolve. Periodically, make the criteria stricter, announcing these changes well in advance. This allows owners to prepare and maintain their maturity level once new criteria are effective.

This approach enables management to drive the adoption of processes that implement computational Data Governance. Steered by the amibition to improve in one or more dimensions of data maturity.

The evolution of criteria is actually even be more powerful than the initial target. Having a low initial maturity level is one thing, but who would want their product to be downgraded in maturity?

And have this reported on?
