## Jeremy's Mission: Enhanced Cash Forecasting

Jeremy set out to build a machine learning model to improve cash forecasting accuracy for the treasury department. He needed temperature data to achieve this, so he searched the data product catalog and found a suitable data product. Jeremy then specified his intended use, availability expectations, and quality level requirements, filing a Data Contract proposal to consume the data.

## Bart's Role: Data Product Owner

Bart, the owner of the desired data product, received Jeremy's request. He validated the purpose for appropriate use and checked the data’s classification and sensitivity. Everything seemed fine, but the required SLA demanded additional quality checks, which Bart added to the product backlog. He updated his product roadmap to include these features in release v2.13 and approved Jeremy's request for the use of v2.13+ for six months. The Data Contract was appended with version and validity, registered in a repository as proof of the new use. The necessary setup for access was automatically provisioned, with notification channels and a dashboard for monitoring SLA and SLO compliance.

## Seeking Operational Cashflow Data

Jeremy also needed operational cashflow data but couldn’t find an existing data product in the catalog. He filed a request to Jean-François, the owner of the relevant data domain, explaining his needs and expectations. Recognizing the importance of Jeremy’s initiative, Jean-François decided to create a new data product. He appointed Stan as the data product owner and set a target delivery date for Jeremy. Once ready, the Data Contract was created, pending a second approval from the DPO due to the data's classification. After the DPO’s confirmation, Jeremy gained access through his registered Data Contract.

## Quality Issues and Resolutions

Using Stan’s data product, Jeremy found that the data quality was insufficient, leading to inaccurate model results. He requested improvements from Stan, who added quality checks and confirmed poor source data quality. Stan escalated the issue to Jean-François, who prioritized a fix on the source application. The urgency was driven by a complaint from Jeremy and his boss, highlighting the substantial business value impacted by the data quality issues.

## Success and Expansion

Bart was pleased with Jeremy as a data product consumer, reporting progress on key KPIs and demonstrating better ROI. Despite no increase in cloud costs, Bart's product contributed significantly to valuable business cases. Stan, with his first consumer, showcased significant data quality improvements at the source, reflected in another KPI. Jeremy, delivering reliable cash forecasts on time, received a "silver" certificate for meeting his SLOs for 100 consecutive days, now visible in the data product catalog.

## New Opportunities and Challenges

Success attracted new interest. The HR department wanted to integrate Stan's operational cashflow data product into their Employee Chatbot. Stan, enthusiastic about his second use case, approved the request, but the DPO rejected the Data Contract due to the data's sensitivity.

Sometimes, data products cannot yet meet business needs. There are many ideas for push notifications and near-realtime insights within the digital landscape. Recognizing this growing demand for continuous data consumption, the platformization team added this capability to their backlog. Once developed, it will be available for all data products, enhancing their interfacing capabilities.
