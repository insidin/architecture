## From Data Steward to Product Steward: Evolving Data Governance Roles in the Era of Data Products

As organizations adopt **data product architectures** and **domain-oriented governance models** — a broader transformation I explored in [this earlier article](https://medium.com/@jan_uyttenhove/embracing-data-as-a-product-a-paradigm-shift-from-traditional-data-warehousing-d43e3ba68fec) — existing roles and responsibilities in data governance are being reshaped. One role particularly affected by this shift is the **data steward**.

Traditionally, data stewards have been part of centralized governance functions, ensuring data quality, consistency, and compliance. However, in the context of data products — where **accountability**, **usability**, and **automation** are integral — the function of stewardship must evolve.

In the referenced article, I noted that "governance duties are performed by the same team managing the data product, ensuring that governance is an integral part of the entire lifecycle." This fundamentally changes the context in which data stewards operate. As governance becomes embedded in product teams, the steward’s role must adapt to remain effective.

### The Traditional Data Steward: A Legacy Role

In conventional data management models, data stewards typically:

- Define and enforce data quality rules
- Work with centralized BI or governance teams
- Oversee domains like customer, finance, or product
- Ensure data consistency and regulatory compliance

They serve as **stewards of data assets**, focused on accuracy, documentation, and trustworthiness. Yet, their scope has often been limited to individual datasets, not the broader **lifecycle of data products**.

### The Paradigm Shift: From Assets to Products

The data product paradigm introduces several foundational changes:

- **Data is packaged for consumption**, with defined interfaces and service levels
- **Ownership is delegated to domain teams** closest to the data
- **Governance must scale** beyond centralized, manual control

This environment demands stewardship that is **proactive, embedded, and continuous**.

### The Product-Aligned Steward

To address this need, the role of the steward must be repositioned as **product-aligned** — embedded within or closely supporting the data product team. This position ensures governance practices are operationalized as part of day-to-day delivery.

#### Core Responsibilities:

- Maintain complete metadata and ensure catalog visibility
- Monitor and manage key data quality indicators (SLIs)
- Handle exception workflows when validations fail
- Maintain data classifications and tagging
- Support onboarding and provide documentation to consumers

This is not about gatekeeping — it’s about enabling trust and compliance at scale.

### Differentiating Steward and Owner Roles

Is the product-aligned steward replacing the data product owner? Not at all. These roles are complementary — together, they enhance the delivery, quality, and reliability of data products.

The **Data Product Owner** is accountable for delivering business value. They define the product roadmap, secure funding, and ensure that service level objectives are met. The **Product-Aligned Steward**, on the other hand, focuses on governance and operational quality. They make sure the data is accurately described, properly monitored, and responsibly managed throughout the lifecycle.

This clear separation of responsibilities prevents role overload and ensures that governance is integrated into delivery — not added as an afterthought.

### Why This Matters

In my own experience working with organizations undergoing this shift, one recurring challenge is the **change management around roles**. Rather than evolving and adapting existing responsibilities, many organizations respond by introducing **new roles** on top of existing ones — often with overlapping or unclear mandates.

This expansion of roles can quickly lead to confusion. People start asking whether all these roles are truly necessary. The governance model becomes harder to navigate, and instead of clarifying ownership, it creates friction.

At the same time, business leaders still expect their **data stewards to fulfill their role** — maintaining quality, oversight, and control — even as the structure around them shifts. This leaves many stewards and governance professionals wondering: *where do I fit in now?*

The product-aligned steward offers a practical and pragmatic path forward. Instead of retiring the steward role or adding new, overlapping roles, this model **evolves stewardship** into a shape that fits the operational reality of data product delivery.

In my experience, many modern data organizations face three hard truths:

- Product owners don’t have the capacity to also be governance operators
- Centralized stewardship teams can’t scale to support dozens or hundreds of products
- Governance needs to be **federated in execution**, not just on paper

By embedding stewardship responsibilities into the product context, the product-aligned steward becomes a key enabler. They help ensure that trust, quality, and compliance are not afterthoughts — but sustained outcomes of everyday data product work.

### Turning Stewardship into Accountability

To embed stewardship effectively, teams must track and review relevant operational metrics, such as:

- Metadata completeness
- Compliance with SLOs/SLIs
- Issue resolution turnaround
- Data freshness and timeliness
- Lineage and impact traceability

These indicators form the backbone of product-level governance — turning stewardship from intent into **measurable performance**.

### Conclusion: From Role Definition to Governance Maturity

Reframing the steward as a **product-aligned operator** is not just a matter of title. It is a strategic response to the demands of modern data product delivery.

By clearly delineating roles, embedding governance in delivery, and institutionalizing stewardship metrics, organizations can ensure data governance remains **sustainable, scalable, and effective**.
